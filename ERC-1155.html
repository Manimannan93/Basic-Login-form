    <p id="erc-1155"><b>The ERC-1155 standard is a token standard on the Ethereum blockchain that combines the features of 
        both ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. It allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible 
        tokens within a single smart contract. ERC-1155 tokens are highly efficient and versatile, making them 
        suitable for various use cases that require the management of multiple token types.
    
        Weâ€™ll use ERC1155 to track multiple items in our game, which will each have their own unique attributes. We mint all items to the deployer of the contract, which we can later transfer to players. Players are free to keep their tokens or trade them with other people as they see fit, as they would any other asset on the blockchain!

        For simplicity we will mint all items in the constructor but you could add minting functionality to the contract to mint on demand to players.
