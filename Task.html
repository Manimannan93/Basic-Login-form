    <h1> Token standards</h1>
    <P>Token standards are the set of rules, conditions, and functions that dictate how a crypto token works. Before delving into token standards, it is helpful to understand the mechanisms of a smart contract standard. Fundamentally, smart contract standards are rules that a smart contract must comply with in order to function as intended on the underlying blockchain network. </P>
